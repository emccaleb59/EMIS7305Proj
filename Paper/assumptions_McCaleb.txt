Assumptions List

Materials in inventory are not replaced over the time period of program analysis.

Aircraft has background reliability curve in series with known problem reliability curve.

All aircraft currently treated as if they fly a fixed average number of hours per day.

All aircraft currently treated as if starting with same number of hours on the airframe.

Aircraft currently resume exact same curve after repair from baseline aircraft reliability failure.

Each aircraft is examined individually by the code so most of these assumptions could be easily loaded from a database with ~500lines
additional code per item stated above.
